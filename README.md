# About This Repository
Just import the .xml files into your project. The function blocks are nearly the same as FB_MoveVelocity and FB_MoveAbsolute. For example: Replace the FB_MoveAbsolute with the version in this library and any changes in velocity automatic.

FB_MoveAbsolute version takes new positions automaticly. 

Enjoy!
